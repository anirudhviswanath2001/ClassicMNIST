## Introduction
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) used for training machine learning models, and 10,000 images for testing. This project demonstrates how to apply the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify these digits.

The KNN algorithm is a simple, yet effective supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In this project, we implement the KNN algorithm to classify the digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`
- `tensorflow` (to load MNIST dataset)
- `pandas`

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/anirudhviswanath2001/ClassicMNIST.git
